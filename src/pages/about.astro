          <p>
            Record Refuge is a personal record shop based in Austin, Texas. We specialize in
            carefully curated vinyl records from various genres, with a focus on quality
            pressings and accurate grading.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every record is inspected, cleaned, and graded honestly before listing.
            We believe in fair prices and transparent descriptions so you know exactly
            what you're getting.
          </p>

          <h2 class="!mt-12 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Grading Standards</h2>
          <p>
            We use the standard Goldmine grading system. All records are visually graded
            and play-tested when condition is uncertain. We err on the side of conservative
            grading.
          </p>

          <h2 class="!mt-12 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Shipping</h2>
          <p>
            All records are shipped in new record mailers with cardboard stiffeners.
            Shipping is a flat $5 within the US, and all orders include tracking.
            International shipping is available upon request.
          </p>
